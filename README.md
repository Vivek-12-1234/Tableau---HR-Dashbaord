Tableau - HR Analytics Dashbaord

HR Dashboard Project – Tableau

I have created an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Tableau to analyze workforce data and provide insights. The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

Overview – Shows total hires, active and terminated employees, yearly hiring and termination trends, employee distribution by department and job titles, and comparison between headquarters in New York and other branches.
Demographics – Provides insights on workforce composition such as gender ratio, age groups, education levels, and the relationship between education background and performance.
Income Analysis – Focuses on salary metrics including comparison across genders and education levels, and the correlation of age with salary in different departments.

This dashboard helps HR teams to monitor employee trends, understand workforce diversity, and analyze salary patterns for better decision making.
